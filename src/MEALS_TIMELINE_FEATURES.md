## 📊 Data Flow (Backend Integration)

When implementing with Supabase:

### DailyTimelinePage Data Fetching:
```sql
-- Get all meals and workouts for a date
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT 
    id, 'meal' as type, meal_type as name, 
    calories, logged_at as timestamp, 'CONSUMED' as status
  FROM meals 
  WHERE user_id = $1 AND meal_date = $2
  
  UNION ALL
  
  SELECT 
    id, 'workout' as type, workout_name as name, 
    -calories_burned as calories, end_time as timestamp, 'WORKOUT' as status
  FROM workouts
  WHERE user_id = $1 AND workout_date = $2
) combined
ORDER BY timestamp ASC;

-- Get daily summary
SELECT * FROM daily_summaries
WHERE user_id = $1 AND date = $2;

-- Get active fitness goal
SELECT * FROM fitness_goals
WHERE user_id = $1 AND is_active = true;
```

### MealDetailModal Data:
```sql
-- Get foods in a meal
SELECT * FROM meal_foods
WHERE meal_id = $1
ORDER BY created_at;

-- Update meal
UPDATE meals SET updated_at = NOW() WHERE id = $1;

-- Delete meal
DELETE FROM meals WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2;

-- Duplicate meal
INSERT INTO meals (user_id, meal_type, meal_date, ...)
SELECT user_id, meal_type, $1 as meal_date, ...
FROM meals WHERE id = $2;
```

### FitnessScoreModal Data:
```sql
-- Get last 7 days of scores
SELECT date, fitness_score FROM daily_summaries
WHERE user_id = $1 AND date >= CURRENT_DATE - 6
ORDER BY date ASC;

-- Calculate score components (backend function)
CREATE FUNCTION calculate_fitness_score(user_id UUID, date DATE)
RETURNS JSON AS $$
  -- Returns breakdown of score components
$$;
```
