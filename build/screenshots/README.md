# PWA Screenshots

Add these screenshot files to showcase your app in the PWA install dialog:

## Required Files:

### `home.png`

- **Dimensions:** 1280x720 pixels (wide format)
- **Content:** Desktop/tablet view of your FareFit dashboard
- **Purpose:** Shows the app on larger screens

### `mobile.png`

- **Dimensions:** 720x1280 pixels (narrow format)

## Tips:
